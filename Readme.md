# Arduino Drivers & Utils

A collection of C++ arduino drivers for various peripherals to speed up development of new projects.

Motivation: don't have to do the debouncing of buttons over and over again on new projects. Instead, bring a button driver already created and do the actual project development.

## Usage

Reference directories "Drivers" and "ThirdParty" to libraries paths to be included in Arduino projects.
